                                    <p>Here is the Product Cycle Pitch that I published before kicking off the project. It is very crucial and tells what we are going to achieve, why and how we will do it but keeping our limitations in our mind and avoid all possible rabbit holes.
                                    
                                    <h5>Title: Let's build design system</h5>
                                    </br>

                                        Our users really like the new features we've been adding, but many of them find the user interface to be a problem. They are not able to use the product to its full potential because of this. Here are some things our users have said:
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                        Users feedback regarding our app interface</br>
                                        "the contrast of the color seems a little bit low in the UI, that's a problem when I use socialbu for long time"</br>
                                        "your UI isn't very easy for my eyes (my team members dislike it). Your platform isn't easy to use"</br>
                                        "seems not very user friendly interface"</br>
                                        "the interface needs some more work for a better workflow"</br>
                                        "not loving the interface, experienced some slowness and glitches"</br>
                                        "i would like to see more features like a smoother interface"
                                        "interface is a little confusing at times"</br>
                                        and more...
                                    </br>
                                        It's all about how it feels when she interacts with the product, the gut feeling. Our current interface is visually very light, complex due to continuous add-ons, and outdated. We can't decide and make direct changes to our interface just for the sake of making it look 'cool'. That's a bad way to go.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>    
                                        Interface is a byproduct of a design system.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                        
                                        We need to develop a design system that not only consistent, self-contained, reusable, accessible, and robust but also make users feel creative, fulfilled, and more productive while interacting with it. It will serve as the foundation for our future development, making things faster, easier, and more effective in the long run. What really includes in a design system?
                                    </br>

                                        An inventory of visual attributes (fundamentals):</br>
                                        - Colors</br>
                                        - Typography</br>
                                        - Spacing</br>
                                        - images/icons
                                    </br>
                                    </br>    
                                        An inventory of each UI element:</br>
                                        - Buttons</br>
                                        - Cards</br>
                                        - Models etc.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>    
                                        Fundamentals are must and should be defined in detail however the scope for UI elements is flexible and can be adjusted.</br>
                                    </br>    
                                        It's a two-weeks cycle.

                                <p>I approached the interface development for SocialBu by starting with less critical pages, like profile settings and billing, followed by features that users don’t use as often, such as automation. This allowed me to implement the design system on low-traffic areas first, ensuring everything was refined before moving on to the main features. By the time I reached the heavily-used pages, the design system was fully tested and mature, minimizing any issues.
